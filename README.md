# RealTimeBusTracker
Title: Real Time Bus Tracker
Uploaded: 10-20-21.

This project displays a map of Boston and shows every bus stop between MIT and Harvard.
A loop is used to mark each stop, in order from MIT and one at  a time, at an interval of 3 seconds.
I added style to the background and button.

How to run? Download all files from this repository into a single folder then drag and drop the html file
into your browser of choice.

In the future I plan to add aditional bus routes from MIT and a darkmode for the map.
